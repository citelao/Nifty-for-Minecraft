HELLO.

This is not compatible with Minecraft 1.0

Just double-click Nifty.command to start.

If Nifty "has invalid permissions" or something, try running Executifier.
If that doesn't work, open up Terminal, type in

    chmod 775

DO NOT PRESS ENTER
Then drag Nifty into the terminal. It should look something like this:

    chmod 775 /Applications/Nifty/Nifty.command

Now press ENTER.

You can quit terminal.
